# finding-donors
Machine learning project

# Introduction

The technique used in this project is supervised learning and requires an analytical approach on the data collected to help CharityML identify the people who would donate. Initally, looked into the data to understand how the census data was recorded. After which, a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques were used to manipulate the data in order to acheive the required format and then looked into different supervised learning methods to apply on the data to reach a specific method which would best suite the solution and then optimized the model which was presented as a solution.  

# Install

The porject requires Python and its libraries: Numpy, scikit-learn, Pandas, matplotlib
Its also recommneded to install Anaconda, which is a Python distribution which containts all the necessary libraries. 

# Run

Using the terminal or command window, open the required project folder and run the following command:

    jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
    
Which will automatically open the file in the browser
